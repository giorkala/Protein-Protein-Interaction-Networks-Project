Files in this folder calculate the shortest distances between any two nodes in each of the 66 PPIN. 
The algorithm used is BFS, implemented in C. 
The C implementation of BFS is an adaptation of the one found here: https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-bfs
Two files used to make these BFS files (cmaker.py and bfs_template.c) are also included.
